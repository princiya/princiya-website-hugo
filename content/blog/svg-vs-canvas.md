As part of my [Outreachy](https://princiya777.wordpress.com/2017/05/05/outreachy-suspense-unfolds/) project work for [Lightbeam](https://github.com/electrolyfish/lightbeam-we/), here is a zine which I drew to understand the differences between SVG & CANVAS elements in the context of visualisation library's performance.
