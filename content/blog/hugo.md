Technically speaking, Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike other systems which dynamically build a page every time a visitor requests one, Hugo does the building when you create your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is optimized for website viewing while providing a great writing experience.

Web site generators render content into HTML files. Most are “dynamic site generators.” But Hugo is a “static site generator.”
