I am a self-learner, self-motivated hard core geeky woman! I like to motivate people, especially women, who take career breaks and want to do a comeback or who want to get started with coding. I am totally in love with JavaScript. Front-end UIs, RESTful back-end APIs, IOT, VR/AR, Data-Viz....I have done it all using JavaScript. During my day job I work with React and Redux. At home I try out things with VR/AR and data visualisations. I want to be a web evangelist on the long run and an active open source contributor this year!
